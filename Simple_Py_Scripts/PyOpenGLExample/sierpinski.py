Sierpinski's triangle.

Sierpinski's triangle∞ is an image which has always fascinated me. The technique
used here is the so called Chaos game∞ here we generate a constellation of points
which ends up being Sierpinski's triangle. The algorithm is as follows:
Pick three points which form the outer boundaries of the triangle
Pick a midpoint of one of the lines which make up an edge
Until we're happy with the amount of detail a new dot is formed by the midpoint of
the current midpoint and one of the three points of the triangle
